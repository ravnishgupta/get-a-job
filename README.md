# Get A Job!

## Overview
This `SPA (Single Page Application)` allows engineers to find work on their own terms! They are able to search for work that fits their skill set and gives them the freedom and flexibility of freelancing. <br>
Engineers must create a profile and log in in order to search and apply for part-time work. <br>
Companies that are looking for free-lance engineers or need certain projects done can post their job needs, review applications, and view candidate's profiles and resumes.<br>
